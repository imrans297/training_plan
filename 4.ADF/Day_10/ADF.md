# Azure Data Factory (ADF) - Complete Guide

## What is Data Factory?

**Data Factory** is a concept in data engineering that refers to a centralized platform or service designed to create, schedule, and manage data workflows. It serves as a hub for data integration, transformation, and movement across various systems and environments.

### Key Characteristics of Data Factory:
- **Data Integration**: Connects disparate data sources
- **ETL/ELT Processing**: Extract, Transform, Load operations
- **Workflow Orchestration**: Manages complex data pipelines
- **Scalability**: Handles large volumes of data
- **Automation**: Reduces manual data processing tasks
