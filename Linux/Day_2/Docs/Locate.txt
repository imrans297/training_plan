A quick note...
In the next few videos, we will be using the locate command!



Depending on what distribution you are running the locate command may not come pre-installed. 
Ubuntu 20.04 appears to have this issue, for example, but Ubuntu 18.04 does not.



If you find you are having issues, try installing the locate  and mlocate packages from your repositories.

sudo apt install locate

sudo apt install mlocate



That should do the trick!



Best wishes,
